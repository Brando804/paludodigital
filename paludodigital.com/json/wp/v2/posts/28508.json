Regularly updated content signals to search engines that a website is active and relevant, which can positively influence rankings. Additionally, a content calendar helps in balancing different content types and formats, catering to diverse audience preferences.<\/p>\n<h2>What metrics should be tracked to measure content strategy impact on SEO?<\/h2>\n<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of a website content strategy on SEO, businesses should track a range of metrics.
